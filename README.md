Unfinished Side-Proj. Designing app that helps memory exercises as taught by Dominic O Brien




Plan to finish at LAHacks.
Description:
This project came out of a need to organize an efficient methodology and routine to practice the exercises outlined in the book “You can have amazing memory” by dominic o Brien. Basically, it’s an app designed to efficiently train you with techniques to be able to memorize a deck of cards forward and back in about 5 minutes, or memorize a hundred random numbers and recite them effortlessly.

Joshua Foer was a reporter and describes in his book, “Moonwalking with Einstein”, his experiences when writing on the world championship memory contests. He learned that none of these guys at the competitions were freak of nature geniuses who could memorize thousands of arbitrary numbers in a sequence, but that they all had a methodology behind their skills and like everything else, can be trained and learned through repetition and practice. He then committed the next 2 years of his life training for the next world championships, 2 hours each day and ended up taking first. 

Basically, to memorize something abstract like a random sequence of numbers, you need to create concrete imagery to associate with the numbers because the brain is able to remember events and visual cues far greater than a random assortment of numbers, (think of why you remember highly emotional or traumatic events and not what you ate for lunch 17 days ago). The hippocampus that is responsible for human memory basically loves sensory detail, and the idea behind all of these exercises is you train yourself to associate everything in a systematic way. 

The most common well-known memory technique is the memory palace, where you can memorize a stack of grocery lists by placing each item in a certain area of your room and visualize and FEEL every sensory detail you can. That way, retraversing through your home in your mind at the grocery store, you can remember the items in order way more effectively than trying to brute force them into your mind.

The dominic system is the underlying structure behind most of the techniques. Basically, how it works is that it assigns every number 0-9 to a letter, and you do pairs of numbers up to 100 and break long numbers up.

For example, 2815-1539 would translate to BH AE AS CN. The dominic table is your list of 100 items and associations, and you basically remember them so you can use them in memorizing these numbers. 
1215-1539 would then be something like Bob Hope, American Eagle, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris.You can memorize these for example in a memory palace by placing bob hope at the door, and when you walk in to the living room you see an eagle flying at you, but then arnold schwarzenegger comes through the kitchen and kills the eagle, but chuck norris flies out of the bathroom and pummels AS to death. 

You gotta pracitce imaging as vivid as you can, because more imagery = deeper engraving in your mind. Pretend that you’re shaking BH’s hand, and the american eagle attacks you in the eyes and feel how painful it is, but then arnold says something in his funny accent and makes you crack up but chuck norris comes out of the bathroom with shit hanging out of his asshole or something.

Another technique is PAO, by assigning each sequence of three pairs to a person, an action and object, in that sequence. But there are literally TONS of exercises that can be implemented with this app and it would be baller if we could make it really presentable at lahacks
